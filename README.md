# Option Pricing Project  
**Author: Filippo Tiberi — BSc Finance, Bocconi University**

This project implements a modular option pricing engine in Python that supports
multiple option types and a unified interface for pricing and Greeks.  
It includes:

- **European Options (Black–Scholes closed form)**
- **Asian Options (Monte Carlo)**
- **American Options (Longstaff–Schwartz Monte Carlo)**
- **Binary Options (cash-or-nothing / asset-or-nothing)**  
- **Greeks via bump-and-revalue**

The codebase is structured to be easy to extend for future research in
quantitative finance and derivatives pricing.
